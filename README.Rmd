# `maars` - an `R` implementation of Models As Approximations

The goal of the `maars` package is to implement the *Models As Approximations* series of
statistics papers [@buja2019modelsasapproximationspart1] and [@buja2019modelsasapproximationspart2]. This package was inspired by the fantastic series of
lectures by [Prof. Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/)
and [Prof. Andreas Buja](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~buja/), 
as part of the __"STAT 36761: Modern Linear Regression"__ course 
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Fall 2020.

## Installation and User Guide

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, 
you can install the development version of `maars` from `GitHub`,
as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shamindras/maars")
```

More detailed instructions and user guides can be found at
